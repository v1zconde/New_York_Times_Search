# The Guilty One App

## Overview of the project

![](Project_gif.gif)

An app that helps users understand how much exercise would be required to offset a given food.
*This app does send user data to a server for processing*

A very big issue we confront everyday it's checking what we ingest and even though it has been simplified by the nutrition facts organization, we mostly do not pay attention to what we consume. We know that life can get so busy that it's difficult to pay attention to our caloric intake and if we don't have an active lifestyle it may lead to weight gain. With our app you will be able to monitor what you ingest based on your approximate caloric intake and add your preffered meal prep for the day. It will take the information from your meal and say how many calories the specific food you want to ingest will have. We will also give you different options on how to burn the calories depending on your choice of excercise. The app also will link to YouTube showing you how to do the chosen excercise.

Made using Foundation, JS, & Jquery public libraries.
