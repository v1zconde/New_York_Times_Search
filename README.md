# The Guilty One App

## Overview of the project

A very big issue we confront everyday it's checking what we ingest and even though it has been simplified by the nutrition facts organization, we mostly do not pay attention to what we consume. We know that life can get so busy that it's impossible to pay attention to our caloric intake and if we don't have an active lifestyle it may lead to weight gain. A lot of us had been there and we know how difficult it is but we developed the app for you! With our app you will be able to monitor what you ingest based on your approximate caloric intake and add your preffered meal prep for the day. It will take the information from your meal and say how many calories the specific food you want to ingest will have. We will also give you different options on how to burn that calories depending on your choice and it will say how many miles or x amount of repetition of x excercise you need. Our app also will give you videos showing you how to do those excercise.
